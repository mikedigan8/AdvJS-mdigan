## GAME INSTRUCTIONS
The rules are simple: Try to build a row of four checkers while keeping your opponent from doing the same. Sounds easy, but it's not! The vertical strategy creates a unique challenge: you must think in a whole new way to block your opponent's moves!
<br>

### OBJECTIVE
Be the first player to get four of your checker in a row      "--horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

<br>

### HOW TO PLAY
1. Decide who plays first. Players will alternate turns after playing a checker.
    #### NOTE: 
    The player starting the first game will play in the next game.
2. On your turn, select a column number and hit "Enter" to drop one of your checkers down ANY of the slots.
3. Play alternates until one player gets FOUR checkers of his or her color in a row. The four in a row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.

### HOW TO WIN
If you're the first player to get four of your checkers in a row, you win the game!
